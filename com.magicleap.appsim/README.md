## Package name: com.magicleap.appsim

### A Unity-based UI for Magic Leap App Simulator

Requirements:
- Magic Leap SDK installed and configured in Unity Preferences > External Tools
- Magic Leap App Simulator Runtime package installed via Magic Leap Hub

Unity will attempt to import support libraries from the latest App Sim runtime you have installed. It is recommend to configure your Unity project's version control to ignore `Assets/Plugins/Editor/zi` as the files are dependent on your personal development environment, including OS.
